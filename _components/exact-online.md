## Working with dynamic metadata

On the "Configure input" step, firstly, you should choose an entity (object) type you want to work with. Click on the "Object type to..." and wait for data uploading.
Then you'll see a list of entities which are available for this action or trigger. You should choose one.

Then you wait for uploading metadata (input object structure). After metadata uploaded you can complete input object to retrieve response sample.
Be careful of required fields with a red mark.

Structure of the input object will be based on objectType field content.

# Triggers
## Webhook Subscription

Webhook enables the receiving of real-time data updates from Exact Online division.
These updates are generated by user transactions as the envelope progresses through actions to completion.
The Exact Online webhook provides updated information about the entities changes.
Notification messages include information about the current status of the entity.

See [trigger limitations](#current-limitations)

# Actions

## Lookup Objects

Allows to get a list of all entities with current type in your division or to get entities that satisfy the filter. This action emits multiple results of required objects.

### Input fields
 - **Object type to get** - dropdown list with all types of the entities, required field. Select the type of entity you want to get.
 - **Number of search terms** - not required field, number of search terms. Determines the number of search terms that the entity must match. Need to be an integer value from 1 to 100. If this field is empty, action emits all entities with selected type.

### Input metadata

Metadata is depending on the input field `Number of search terms`.
If `Number of search terms` is empty, metadata does not exist.
If `Number of search terms` = 1, metadata has only one search term.
If `Number of search terms` > 1, metadata has a number of search term equal `Number of search terms` and a number of criteria link equal '`Number of search terms` - 1'.

Each search term has 3 fields:

 - **Field Name** - chosen entity's field name. You need to select the one field from `Value` section:

 - **Condition** - You need to select the one condition from `Value` section:

 - **Field Value** - the value that the field must match with the specified condition.

Between search terms, there is **Criteria Link**. You need to select the one criteria from `Value` section:

For example, if you want to find all entities with types `Contacts` with field `ID` greater than `1` and field `IsMainContact` equal `true`:

### Output metadata

JSON schema location folder: [schemas/io/...](schemas/io). The necessary schema begins with the `get` and ends with the `.out` and has an entity type between. For example, for entity `Accounts` schema has name `getAccounts.out.json`

# Current Limitations
## Triggers

### Webhook Subscription

According to Exact Online documentation, you can't create more than one webhook for the same topic, so webhook subscription trigger will remove, on start,
all existing webhooks with callback URL or topic which are same to current.

## Actions


### Lookup Objects
 - action currently does not support filtering by a null value
 - action currently does not support choosing fields to return
 - if any entity was not found, the action did not provide data
 - you need to set the `Field Value` according to the field type, `Field Value` is `string` in the metadata and is checked only when executed. You can check type of the field in the schema [there](schemas/io). The necessary schema begins with the `get` and ends with the `.in` and has an entity type between. For example, for entity `Accounts` schema has name `getAccounts.in.json`


### Update Entity
Can be used for entities that can't be inserted via API only. This action was not fully tested due to the lack of documentation at the Exact Online official documentation. Actionâ€™s metadata should be additionally discussed with ExactOnline developers or support team.

# Additional info
